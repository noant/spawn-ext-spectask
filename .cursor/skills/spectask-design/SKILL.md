description: Use when registering architecture files in spec/design.yaml or drafting spec/design/*.md.

**Mandatory:** read **spec/main.md** in full before acting — especially Folder Structure and Step 7 design rules.

**Role:** `A1-drafter`

**Steps:** ad-hoc design docs / `spec/design.yaml` (not a Status step). Post-impl updates → Step 7.

**Rules:** `R1-paths`, `R2-no-clutter`, `R10-ask`, `R14-changed-files`

**Flow:**

1. Read **spec/main.md** fully — Folder Structure (`spec/design.yaml`, `spec/design/hla.md`, `spec/design/{name}.md`) and Step 7 Index / Scope / Write rules for design docs.
2. Add or edit `spec/design/{name}.md` as needed; keep paths under Folder Structure only (`R1-paths`).
3. Register or update rows in `spec/design.yaml` (`path` + `description`).
4. List changed files (`R14-changed-files`). Do not run the full Steps 1–7 Status cycle unless the user is closing a task via Step 7.


Hints:
- Use the platform ask tool when available (R10-ask in spec/main.md); otherwise, stop and request input from the user.
- No emojis or exotic Unicode in code, logs, documentation, or messages; plain ASCII where practical.
- User-facing replies, documentation, and task descriptions: concise wording; minimal markdown (avoid decorative bold/italic); explain with lists and structure; short, clear sentences.
- Specifications, code comments, and project documentation must be written in English.
- If the user only asked a question, answer first; do not edit files unless changes are clearly needed.

Mandatory reads:
- `spec/main.md` - Spec-Tasks methodology — folder structure, seven-step process, overview template.
- `spec/design.yaml` - Index of architecture documents under spec/design/ — path and description per entry.
- `spawn/navigation.yaml` - Merged Spawn navigation (read-required, read-contextual).

Contextual reads:
- `spec/design/hla.md` - Project high-level architecture; updated in Step 7.
